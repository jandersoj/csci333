//		Create another class in the same package, with a main method for testing the BinarySearchTree class. 
//		In main, test your BinarySearchTree class, by doing at least the following:
//		Create a BinarySearchTree and insert at least 20 elements into it.
//		Do pre- in- and post-order traversals of the tree, and also print its size.
//		Search for at least 5 keys in the tree and 5 keys not in the tree, and print all inputs and results to the console.
//		Delete a handful of elements from the tree, print its size again, then do another in-order traversal to print out the contents.
//		Test the select and rank methods by querying each of those at least 5 times with different arguments, and printing the results.
