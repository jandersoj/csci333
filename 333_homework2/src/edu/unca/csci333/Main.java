//	Create a second class in the same package as the MaxHeap class; 
//	this class will contain only the main method.  
//	Its purpose is to create some MaxHeap objects and test them.  
//	(Bear in mind that the only public methods of MaxHeap are the constructor, printMaxHeap, and heapsort.)
//	Use at least 5 different arrays filled with values to make at least 5 different MaxHeap objects. 
//	For each object:

//	Print out the original array that it was constructed from 
//	-- the one with values in arbitrary order. 
//	You can use the java.util.Arrays.toString method.
	
//	Print out the heap with printMaxHeap. 
//	By looking at the console it should be obvious the values are rearranged,
//	from the buildMaxHeap that was invoked in the constructor.
	
//	Invoke heapsort.
	
//	Print out the heap again with printMaxHeap. 
//	In the console you should notice all the values are sorted.
